# Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

## Overview of Analysis

Pewlett-Hackard is a large company with several thousand employees and many of them are reaching retirement. The retirement will leave thousands of job openings. In order to prepare for this, Pewlett-Hackard will need to determine who will be retiring in the next few years and how many positions need to be filled. SQL was used to determine the number of retiring employees per title and to identify employees that are eligible for a mentorship program that Pewlett-Hackard is offering. 

## Results

To determine the number of employees retiring per title only those that were born between the years 1952 and 1955 were included. This makes the assumption that those born between 1952 and 1955 will be retiring soon.
